MeetupMixup returns once more; a combined networking and social event to celebrate the festive season and a year full of meetups!

Members of some of Sydneyâ€™s largest user groups will be gathering on December 13th for an evening of celebrations to round out the year and welcome the holiday season.

The mixer is a non-profit networking & social event that is run by the local community for the benefit of the local community.
