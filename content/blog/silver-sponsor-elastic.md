## Announcing our silver sponsor - Elastic

We're super excited to welcome [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) as our first silver sponsor of MeetupMixup!

Elastic builds software to make data usable in real time and at scale for search, logging, security, and analytics use cases. Founded in 2012, the company develops the open source Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash), X-Pack (commercial features), and Elastic Cloud (a SaaS offering).

Thank you Elastic!
