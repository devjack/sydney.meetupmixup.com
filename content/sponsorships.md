We couldn't hold a #mumu17 without the support of our amazing sponsors.

We range of sponsorships designed for businesses and organisations of all sizes. Financial sponsorship allows us to run MeetupMixup at a low cost for attendees, helping us keep the event accessible to all members of the community.

For individuals, we have [community sponsorship tickets](/tickets). These tickets ($50 per person) are a way to help finance the event in return for inclusion in our community sponsorships page.

For companies and organisations we have [formal sponsorship opportunities]((/meetupmixup2017_prospectus.pdf)) to place your brand front and centre.
